# **ReactiveSlimes Minecraft Batch Launcher**

## Small time batch script developer and I just make scripts in my free time but this one is different. It's my first one I have put up online.

**Back story on how I began this project:**
I'm in collage year 11 and me and some other students in our robotic class wanted to play Minecraft but there were some problems  
1: No one knew how to get to the default Minecraft folder   
2: The collage had a proxy so the clients couldn't connect to the authentication servers for login

**Problem 1 solution**
I over come these problems with a small batch script because I found out that the Java executable  (use Java launcher because collage blocked .exe) supported some arguments the most impotent being  **--workDir**  which changed the Minecraft folder to a different location so I didn't have to get to every ones default Minecraft folder.

**Problem 2 solution**
To solve the login problem when I got home I copied a clean Minecraft folder with my login but changed the 
display name so we were all logged in and could play on a local server

*Doing this also resulted in me being banned from school computers for 2 weeks*

# Why did I continue this project?

A friend of mine has a shared family computer and sometimes the younger siblings would delete his saves. My friend asked me if I could make a user account were each user would have there own Minecraft folder. All that was done after about an hour but I keep finding ways of making it better and you can see them in [Features](#features)
